                    img: "samal.png", 
                    guide: "Samal Travel Guide", 
                    details: "Samal is the only city in the country that encompasses two entire islands, hence its name the Island Garden City. While pristine beaches dot the island's shores, hills dominate the middle portions of the island. Talikud Island is located southwest of the main island." ,
                    howToGo: "Since Samal Island doesn't have its own airport, the main jump-off point is Davao City. Here are some ways on how to get to Samal Island via Davao City. By Flights: The closest airport to Samal Island is the Davao International Airport or Francisco Bangoy International Airport so the most convenient option is to take a flight to Davao. Airlines such as Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and Air Asia fly numerous times daily to Davao City from several cities across the country. For those coming from Luzon, you can take a  Manila to Davao flight. Meanwhile, those from Visayas can catch a Cebu to Davao flight, Bohol to Davao flight, or Bacolod to Davao flight. Travelers already in Mindanao can opt for a Cagayan to Davao flight or Zamboanga to Davao flight, among others.  There are also flights flying to Davao City from international destinations like Singapore, Doha, Hong Kong, and Quanzhou, China. By Ferry: From Davao City, take two connecting jeepney rides or book a transfer going to Sta. Ana Wharf. From there, take the Palboros passenger ferry boat going to Kaputian Beach in Samal Island. The boat trip lasts 40 minutes. By Bus: Island City Express is the lone bus line that services the route of Davao City and Samal Island. Your bus fare is already inclusive of the ferry fee. You can take this bus from Agdao in Davao City going to Sasa Wharf. The bus is then loaded into the ferry as a RORO (Roll-on, roll-off) transport going to Samal Island.",
                    details2: "Make the most of your trip in Samal Island by adding these tourist spots and activities in your itinerary: Explore the Island on a Motorcycle Like most small islands in the Philippines, Samal Island is best explored on a two-wheel ride. To fully explore the island you can either rent a motorcycle or hire a habal-habal driver to take you around. Samal Island has a smooth road infrastructure that connects most towns and circles almost the whole island. Explore Monfort Bat Cave: At Monfort Bat Cave, you will get the chance to see up close thousands of fruit-eating bats in their natural habitat. Don't worry, because you will be visiting during the daytime, you will witness these countless bats going about their daily routine–which is sleeping soundly. The sight of bats hanging from the cave's ceilings and walls is quite a magnificent scene. Go Spelunking:  Aside from the Monfort Bat Cave, you can still relive your inner Indian Jones by exploring the other cave systems found in Samal Island. Caves such as Baga, Magongawong, and Balete all feature stunning series of chambers dotted with spectacular stalactite and stalagmite formations. Even if you are traveling on a budget, you can still set foot on this luxurious resort known all over the world for a day. Pearl Farm offers a day tour for visitors to Samal Island and is usually included in island hopping tours. You can check out the resort's facilities and enjoy frolicking at their white sand beach and swim on its turquoise-colored waters. Other activities you can do here include jet-skiing, banana boat, diving, and kayaking."

                    guide: "Magpupungko Travel Guide", 
                    details: "Magpupungko Beach is a blissful place in Siargao that is known for its rock formations, white-sand beach and crystal clear blue waters. Visitors will surely have a great time bumming on its wide stretch while gazing at its charming surroundings. The beach area is filled with several eateries and food stalls that offer a good variety of local dishes." ,
                    howToGo: "When I visited in 2017 there was only one flight a day from Manila and one from Cebu. Now there are 10-15 flights a day so the question of how to get to Siargao has become much easier. Without going into deep detail on every single option. These are the options for how to get to Siargao: Fly from Manila $90-$100 Fry from Cebu  $90-$100 Ferry from Surigao City to Siargao Island $5 There are ferries that leave from Manila and Cebu but they go to Surigao City first and then Siargao Island. On our second day in Siargao, my friends and I set out to explore Magpupungko Rock Pools in Pilar, about an hour’s drive from General Luna. Many travelers rent motorcycles (around 500 pesos per day) and make the trip independently. Since we weren’t familiar with the route, we asked the local who guided us to Bucas Grande on our first day to help us out. After a quick negotiation that morning, we agreed to rent an additional motorcycle for our group of three. If you prefer not to drive yourself, land transfers to Magpupungko Rock Pools are easily available. You can arrange them through locals or book online with several tour providers who offer guided trips. Either way, getting to this stunning natural attraction is straightforward. Here are some of the tours to choose from online:",
                    details2: "Cliff-Jumpin: It is a bit tricky to climb the rock, but anyone gutsy can definitely do it. The water is refreshing and Magpupungko’s cliff-jumping will give you an adrenaline rush. Snorkeling: If you don’t want to jump off the cliffs, you can go snorkeling instead. The tide pools are teeming with little fish. It is a great way to relax and appreciate the pool from a different perspectives. I mean, we always see drone photos of the pool, but underwater is equally interesting. Enjoy some food by the beach:  After a few hours of Magpupungko fun, you will definitely get hungry. Worry not because there are several restaurants and food stalls by the beach. You can enjoy some fresh seafood while overlooking the beautiful ocean. Lounge on the beach: If you’re not up for any Magpupungko activity, you can just lounge on the beach and enjoy the view. It is a great place to relax and unwind. There are also several hammocks where you can take a nap. Around the rock pools are various small caves to explore and bare hills to climb, albeit rocky. The most famous rock formation on the coast, apart from the pools, is the large boulder that perilously rests on a flat stone. This limestone boulder resembles the shape of squatting, which in the Surigaonon dialect is pungko.   When you wander through the Magpupungko rock pools past the boulder, you will find yourself in a different secluded beach. When dry, the sand is soft, into which the feet sink easily with every step."

Part of the Cordillera Central, it is covered by a forest of tall, tropical hardwoods; two subsidiary peaks nearly match its height.",
                    howToGo: "Davao is well connected to both Manila and Cebu City, the two busiest international airports in the Philippines. Cebu Pacific Air, the local low-cost carrier with a new and modern fleet, offer cheap daily flights from both Manila and Cebu starting at less than 2000 pesos (one-way). I flied from Cebu City and paid 2500 pesos (one-way), and back to Cebu City for 1800 pesos only (one-way). One can either stay a night in Davao City or go directly to Santa Cruz (45 km southwest of Davao), where a permit and guide/porter for Mount Apo must be arranged. After arriving Davao International Airport, try to avoid the taxi-touts at the entrance/exit who will try to charge 1500 pesos for a ride to Santa Cruz. Walk instead 50 metres from the terminal, where the white or yellow metred-taxis are. Here you can easily negotiate a price of 600-700 pesos. If you are on a really tight budget it will be even cheaper to commute like described below (total 207 pesos): 1. After arriving at Davao International Airport, ride a taxi to Ecoland Transport Terminal (travel time 20 minutes - 150 pesos) 2. At Ecoland Terminal, look for south-bound buses such as yellow bus, weena bus, ACFB or Metro Shuttle and ask the driver or the conductor that you will be dropped off at Santa Cruz Terminal (travel time 45 minutes to 1 hour - 43 pesos). 3. At Santa Cruz Terminal, take a motorcycle or tricycle taxi to the municipal hall, Tourism Office (travel time 5 minutes - 14 pesos) To get from Santa Cruz to the trailhead in Baruring you can hire a jeep for 800 pesos or commute. The latter would be cheaper, 3 persons would cost 400+ pesos, but the time-frame would be more uncertain. While a jeep will take 1-1.5 hours to the trailhead in Baruring, commuting will take at least 2-3 hours depending on availability/departure of share-taxis, motorcycle taxis etc. First you need a bus from Santa Cruz to Digos, then a shared van/taxi from Digos to Kapatagan, and finally a motorcycle-taxi from Kapatagan to Baruring. This will be quite complicated and time-consuming, but at least you have your guide to take care of this.",
                    details2: "Hiking and Camping Gears: Before we buy our hiking and camping gear, we make sure to do research or ask for guidance from people who have been in this activity for a while. The husband spent hours doing research for our hiking bag, sleeping bag, jackets (rain, down, and fleece), and shoes. It’s also a good thing that we are surrounded by outdoor friends whom we bother with questions every now and then. (Shout out to Andrew, Mark, Beboy, and Aldrich). Below are our companion’s things to bring to Mt. Apo. The author of this blog is mountaineer for more than a decade, a surfer for more than 7 years and created the Telecommunications Ecological and Adventure Klab ( TEAK) in Davao City. His active lifestyle and adventures lead him to the beautiful wonders and views of his country such as mountains, waterfalls, white beaches in its natural state and the rich culture of the people especially in Davao Province where Mt. Apo is situated in which he photographs and documents each and every one of them. As time goes by his adventures extends around Asia where he went to Nepal and did the Annapurna Circuit, visited Sabah and trekked Mt. Kinabalu and Mt. Rinjani in Lombok, Indonesia. On these travels, he met local people in their respective areas and established contact with them and shares his experiences through photo documentation to others. Sharing his personal experience, he wants to go back to places where he went and share it with others and explore further. Emergency Hiking and Camping Items Nature is unpredictable so it is always better to be ready for what is coming. These are items that we are happy not to be able to use but are good things to have while on the trek."

                    howToGo: "Car: If you're driving from Zamboanga City, take the National Road (also known as the Zamboanga-Dipolog Road) heading north. The journey will take approximately 5-6 hours. Once you arrive in Dipolog City, follow the signs to Linabo Peak. You will need to park in the designated area near the base of the 3003 Steps. Be prepared to pay a small parking fee, typically around 20-50 PHP. Public Transportation (Bus): From Zamboanga City, head to the bus terminal and take a bus bound for Dipolog City. The fare is usually around 300-400 PHP. The bus ride will take about 6-7 hours. Once you arrive at the Dipolog City bus terminal, you can take a tricycle to the base of the 3003 Steps Linabo Peak. The tricycle fare will be approximately 50-100 PHP. Tricycle: After reaching the Dipolog City bus terminal, hire a tricycle to take you to the starting point of the 3003 Steps Linabo Peak. The journey should take about 15-20 minutes, depending on traffic. Make sure to negotiate the fare beforehand, which should be around 50-100 PHP. Hiking: Once you arrive at the base of the 3003 Steps Linabo Peak, prepare for a hike. The trail is well-marked, and it is advisable to start your hike early in the morning to avoid the heat. The climb consists of 3003 steps, and it can take about 1-2 hours to reach the top, depending on your pace. Ensure you bring enough water and wear appropriate hiking gear.",
                    details2: "During Holy Week, especially on Good Friday, Catholics in the whole province of Zamboanga del Norte perform their penitential rites in “Katkat Sakripisyo”. On the way up, there are 14 stops which correspond to the Station of the Cross. There’s a novena on Good Friday that starts at 4AM and followed by a mass at the elementary school which is located on top of the peak. It is the most visited place in the city. Thousands of devotees which range from children to adults will be usually seen in the place but most of them are teenagers. When you reach the peak, you will be rewarded by the beautiful scenery of the two cities of Zamboanga del Norte, Dipolog and Dapitan. The air above the ground is so refreshing that dries away your sweat. Taking a break at the peak and having some picnic is also great to do before going down. You can also checkout the towers of some cellular sites that are situated at the peak. There are 2 routes to reach the peak, the one with the cemented steps and the other one with a longer route. I would suggest that when going up, you take the cemented steps. Take the longer route and enjoy the nice spots on the other side of the peak on going down the peak. Just make sure you will ask the locals the right way."

                    howToGo: "It should be noted that we contacted a travel guide/ habal-habal driver in Hinatuan for our trip in Surigao del Sur. We have arranged the itinerary for both Enchanted River and Tinuy-an Falls for a single day. If you’re going to come from Butuan, it’s better to stay overnight in Hinatuan or Bislig because traveling from Agusan del Norte can take about 5 hours or more. You won’t be able to enjoy the Tinuy-an if you’re in the rush. It’s best to contact a guide when you go here especially when you have limited time in your travel. You can arrange with him (or her) your itinerary when you visit. You can always choose to stay in Tinuy-an Falls for a whole day (as there are many activities you can do here including swimming, trekking, bird watching and wildlife or landscape photography), but if you’re pressed with time, it’s okay if you’ll just stay here for a half day. If you went to the province of Surigao del Sur using your car, you can easily drive your car going here. Tinuy-an Falls can be located via Google Maps, which we have tried while going here. It’s best to visit in the morning. You’d want to have good lighting when you’re going to take pictures of the falls!",
