            <p>The Philippines is located in Southeast Asia, on the eastern rim of the Asiatic Mediterranean. It is bounded in the west by the South China Sea; in the east by the Pacific Ocean; in the south by the Sulu and Celebes Seas; and in the north by the Bashi Channel.  Its capital and main port of entry is Manila. Cebu, which is some 562 kilometers to the south of Manila, is the second largest international gateway to the country.</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an archipelago consisting of 7,100 islands with a total land area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers. It has three major island groups-Luzon in the north, Visayas in the middle and Mindanao further down in the South. The current population of the Philippines is about 80 million people. Filipinos are basically of Indo-Malay racial stock, mixed with some Chinese and Spanish ancestry.</p>

            <p>Historians believe the Philippines dates back to the Paleolithic age. Based on the archaeological artifacts recovered, Filipino society and culture were fairly developed prior to contacts with other countries.
                Filipinos had commercial relations early on with China, Indo-China, Malaysia, India and Arab countries. Chinese silk, porcelain, jars, gold ivory, and beads were traded for wax, bird's nest, teakwood, rattan, pearls, precious stones and other marine and forest products.</p>
            <p>Spanish Colonial Period : Ferdinand Magellan came to the Philippines on March 16, 1521 and claimed the country for the Spanish crown. A colonial government was established in Manila in 1571. Spain introduced changes in the political, social and cultural life of the people. One of these is Christianity.
                In 1896, the Filipinos staged the first nationalistic revolution in Asia against the Spaniards. The 1896 Revolution was the culmination of revolts against Spanish oppression.</p>
