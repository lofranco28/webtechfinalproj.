                    details2: "It’s highly recommended to do your hike around November to March, a season wherein there is less rain. This is common knowledge, but I feel the need to reiterate it because some hikers just seem like they’re going to elope given the number and size of their bags on this regular hike. Sure, that much packing and preparedness will help strengthen your chances of survival if you get lost in the mountain (let’s hope that doesn’t happen)… but for simple hikes such as this Mt Pulag hike, it’s best to contain yourself. And by that, I mean: just pack light and only the essentials. I considered myself to as out-of-shape back when I did this hike, but I managed with a medium-sized day pack (not even those hiking backpacks) and it all contained the things that I needed. I didn’t need a porter either (someone who could carry your things for you)."

                    details2: "Walking is a great way to explore Calle Crisologo, as there is little to no vehicular traffic (except for the kalesas that are allowed). You can go inside some of the houses, which have been restored or turned into souvenir shops, hotels, or restaurants. Most of them still maintain the old-world charm through red-tiled roofs, decorative doors, high ceilings, and capiz windows. Do stay until nighttime when the lamps along the street are lit, and tables are set up for dining, as it gets more charming and a tad romantic. If you want an extra flair of colonial style, visit the Ilocos Sur Provincial Tourism Office. Here you can rent a filipiniana or barong (traditional Filipino costumes) to authentically exude that era’s style as you walk through Calle Crisologo. Nearby Calle Crisologo is Plaza Salcedo, Vigan's main square and gathering point. At night, it's an audio-visual spectacle thanks to a dancing fountain light show. Be at the Plaza Salcedo before 7:00 P.M. on weekdays to witness this 30-minute show that synchronizes the spouting of the water fountain to colorful lights and infectious music. On weekends, there is a second show at 8:30 P.M. It is located in the main square of the city. Also known as the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Conversion of St. Paul, it was founded in the 17th century, and is one of the oldest Augustinian churches in the Philippines. It boasts of a modified Baroque architecture, made by the Ilocanos to withstand earthquakes. The church has also gone through many disasters but has been restored."
